# travel app:
 a Javascript code for a simple travel app.
 it uses the geoname api, weathebit api, pexabay api to provide the maximum accuracy.

 it is very simple to use the code, just run: `npm run dev` to use webpack-dev-server on the dev-mode.
 and run `npm run prod` then `npm start` to run the server in the production mode.

 ## any thing you need to know??
 no, just dig in the code and manipulate it as you heart desire.
